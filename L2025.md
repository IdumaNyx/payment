Hereâ€™s the updated guide with steps and full code for creating a POC using SAP RAP with data pulled from the DMO tables in SAP BTP:


---

Step 1: Set Up the Environment

1. Activate ABAP Environment in SAP BTP Trial:

Follow the SAP BTP Trial Guide.

Ensure you can access the ABAP Environment.



2. Use Business Application Studio:

Set up a dev space for "Full Stack Cloud Application" with ABAP enabled.



3. Ensure DMO Data Availability:

Check that tables SCUSTOM (customers) and SFLIGHT (products) are available in your trial environment.





---

Step 2: Define the Orders Table

You need a custom table to store generated orders.

Orders Table (ZORDERS)

@EndUserText.label: 'Orders'
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZV_ORDERS'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
define table zorders {
  key order_id    : abap.char(10);
  customer_id     : abap.char(10);
  product_id      : abap.char(20); " Concatenated carrier ID and connection ID
  price           : abap.curr(15,2);
}


---

Step 3: Define RAP Behavior

Define a behavior for the ZORDERS table to allow creating and managing records.

Behavior Definition (ZORDERS)

@EndUserText.label: 'Orders Behavior'
define behavior for zorders alias Orders
implementation in class zbp_orders unique {
  create;
}


---

Step 4: Create the Business Logic

Implement a behavior class to pull data from DMO tables (SCUSTOM and SFLIGHT), generate combinations, and populate the ZORDERS table.

Behavior Class (ZBP_ORDERS)

CLASS zbp_orders DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  FINAL
  CREATE PUBLIC .

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES if_rap_behavior_handler.
    METHODS:
      generate_orders RETURNING VALUE(rt_orders) TYPE TABLE OF zorders.

  PROTECTED SECTION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS zbp_orders IMPLEMENTATION.

  METHOD generate_orders.
    " Fetch customers from SCUSTOM
    SELECT customer_id name
      FROM scustom
      INTO TABLE @DATA(it_customers).

    " Fetch products (flights) from SFLIGHT
    SELECT carrid connid price
      FROM sflight
      INTO TABLE @DATA(it_products).

    " Combine customers and products to generate orders
    LOOP AT it_customers INTO DATA(customer).
      LOOP AT it_products INTO DATA(product).
        DATA(order) = VALUE zorders(
          order_id    = |{ sy-tabix }|   " Unique ID generation
          customer_id = customer-customer_id
          product_id  = product-carrid && product-connid
          price       = product-price ).
        APPEND order TO rt_orders.
      ENDLOOP.
    ENDLOOP.

    " Save orders to the database
    MODIFY zorders FROM TABLE rt_orders.
  ENDMETHOD.

ENDCLASS.


---

Step 5: Define Service and Service Binding

Create a service definition and bind it to expose the data via OData.

Service Definition (ZRAP_ORDER_SRV)

@EndUserText.label: 'Order Service'
define service ZRAP_ORDER_SRV {
  expose zorders as Orders;
}

Service Binding (ZRAP_ORDER_BIND)

1. In the service binding folder, create a new binding.


2. Choose OData V4 as the binding type.


3. Publish the service.




---

Step 6: Display Orders in Fiori

1. Fiori Elements App:

Use the generated OData service to create a Fiori app.

Choose a list report template to display the ZORDERS data.



2. Excel Export:

Use the built-in export feature in Fiori Elements.





---

Step 7: Test the Application

1. Verify DMO Data:

Use SE16N or SQL Console to confirm the data in SCUSTOM and SFLIGHT.



2. Test the Generate Orders Logic:

Use the RAP service to execute the generate_orders method.

Verify that orders are stored in the ZORDERS table.



3. Export Orders:

Open the Fiori app and export the data as an Excel file.

Complete Code

1. Orders Table (ZORDERS)

@EndUserText.label: 'Orders'
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZV_ORDERS'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
define table zorders {
  key order_id    : abap.char(10);
  customer_id     : abap.char(10);
  product_id      : abap.char(20);
  price           : abap.curr(15,2);
}

2. Behavior Definition (ZORDERS)

@EndUserText.label: 'Orders Behavior'
define behavior for zorders alias Orders
implementation in class zbp_orders unique {
  create;
}

3. Business Logic (ZBP_ORDERS)

CLASS zbp_orders DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  FINAL
  CREATE PUBLIC .

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES if_rap_behavior_handler.
    METHODS:
      generate_orders RETURNING VALUE(rt_orders) TYPE TABLE OF zorders.

  PROTECTED SECTION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS zbp_orders IMPLEMENTATION.

  METHOD generate_orders.
    " Fetch customers from SCUSTOM
    SELECT customer_id name
      FROM scustom
      INTO TABLE @DATA(it_customers).

    " Fetch products (flights) from SFLIGHT
    SELECT carrid connid price
      FROM sflight
      INTO TABLE @DATA(it_products).

    " Combine customers and products to generate orders
    LOOP AT it_customers INTO DATA(customer).
      LOOP AT it_products INTO DATA(product).
        DATA(order) = VALUE zorders(
          order_id    = |{ sy-tabix }|   " Unique ID generation
          customer_id = customer-customer_id
          product_id  = product-carrid && product-connid
          price       = product-price ).
        APPEND order TO rt_orders.
      ENDLOOP.
    ENDLOOP.

    " Save orders to the database
    MODIFY zorders FROM TABLE rt_orders.
  ENDMETHOD.

ENDCLASS.

4. Service Definition (ZRAP_ORDER_SRV)

@EndUserText.label: 'Order Service'
define service ZRAP_ORDER_SRV {
  expose zorders as Orders;
}
